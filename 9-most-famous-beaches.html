          The beach of Navagio, also known as Shipwreck cove, is Zakynthos' most famous beach, located on the western side of the Ionian island, close to Anafotiria village. The Shipwreck is one of Greece's most photographed attractions. It is regarded as one of Greece's most beautiful beaches. It was originally named Agios Georgios but got its new name after the shipwreck of a boat carrying illegal cigarettes in 1983. The ship washed up on the beach. The beach recently voted as best in the world, is a popular tourist destination famous for its signature shipwreck.
        </p>
        <p class="x-lgswq">
          But in recent days, the iconic Shipwreck beach or Navagio beach, in Zakynthos, Greece will remain closed to tourists this summer for fear of landslides, authorities on the island announced on Wednesday.
          The decision to prohibit access to the Navagio beach was recommended by a team of experts from the Anti-Seismic Planning and Protection Organization (<a href="https://www.oasp.gr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OASP</a>), following a visit to the site on March 8, as part of a regular safety check.

          South Beach, also nicknamed colloquially as SoBe, is a neighborhood in Miami Beach, Florida. It is located east of Miami between Biscayne Bay and the Atlantic Ocean. The area encompasses Miami Beach south of Dade Boulevard. Miami Beach, a slender, nine-mile-long barrier island along the Atlantic Ocean, is divided into three distinct neighborhoods. South Beach from South Pointe Park north to 23rd Street is the most famous of the trio, home to sandy strands, swaying palms and the pastel-colored Art Deco buildings that have become synonymous with this iconic destination and render it so undeniably photogenic.

          Whitehaven Beach is a pristine, award winning beach on Whitsunday Island, the largest of the 74 islands in the Whitsundays. Whitehaven Beach stretches over seven kilometres and boasts brilliant white silica sand that is among the purest in the world. Sink your feet into the sand and wade into the warm waves that gently lap the shore and you'll soon realise why people come here from all over the world.
        </p>
        <p class="x-lgswq">
          At the northern end of Whitehaven Beach is Hill Inlet, a stunning inlet where the tide shifts the sand and water to create a beautiful fusion of colours. Many people claim Hill Inlet and Whitehaven Beach are the most beautiful places they've ever seen. The lookout at Tongue Point is the best spot from which to view the swirling sands of Hill Inlet, so if you don't mind a short bushwalk, book your Whitehaven tour with an operator that visits the lookout.

          Maya Bay is a stunningly beautiful bay that's sheltered by 100-metre high cliffs on 3 sides. You can enjoy several beaches here. Most are small and some only exist at low tide. The main beach is around 200 metres long with silky soft white sand. The whole bay is one big reef and the underwater scene features colourful coral and exotic fish in exceptionally clear water.

          Maya Bay is a stunningly beautiful bay that's sheltered by 100-metre high cliffs on 3 sides. You can enjoy several beaches here. Most are small and some only exist at low tide. The main beach is around 200 metres long with silky soft white sand. The whole bay is one big reef and the underwater scene features colourful coral and exotic fish in exceptionally clear water.

          The Seychelles, once thought to be the Garden of Eden, are about as close to heaven on Earth as you can get. The island of La Digue is particularly idyllic, with no airport, no resort chains, and bicycles replacing cars. Its best beach, Anse Source d'Argent, is the epitome of the destination's elephantine granite boulders. Choose a low-cost guesthouse or a luxury hideaway like Le Domaine de L'Orangeraie Resort & Spa.
