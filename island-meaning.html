                  island, any area of land smaller than a continent and entirely surrounded by water. Islands may occur in oceans, seas, lakes, or rivers. A group of islands is called an archipelago.
                  <br> <br>
                  Islands may be classified as either continental or oceanic. Oceanic islands are those that rise to the surface from the floors of the ocean basins. Continental islands are simply unsubmerged parts of the continental shelf that are entirely surrounded by water. Many islands are quite small, covering less than half a hectare (one acre). These tiny islands are often called islets. Islands in rivers are sometimes called aits or eyots. Other islands are huge. Greenland, for example, covers an area of about 2,166,000 square kilometers (836,000 square miles).
                  <br> <br>
                  The islands that rise from the floors of the ocean basins are volcanic. Lava accumulates to enormous thickness until it finally protrudes above the ocean surface. The piles of lava that form Hawaii rise as high as 32,000 feet (9,700 metres) above the ocean floor.
                  <br> <br>
                  Island life exhibits features of special interest. The sea is a barrier to some forms of life but acts as a carrier of others, which, once established in their new home, frequently develop new features in their isolated surroundings. A long-established sea barrier results in marked differences between the animal life and vegetation even of adjacent islands, and from these differences may be deduced the origin of an island. Further, any detailed map of the biological regions of the globe illustrates the importance of islands in the determination of the boundaries of animal-life and vegetational types. For example, to the west of a line (Wallace's Line) running between Bali and Lombok and between Borneo and Celebes, the islands are biologically Asian, but to the east of the line, notwithstanding the narrowness of the Lombok Strait, the vegetation and animal life are Australian. Oceanic islands are usually colonized by only a few animal forms, chiefly seabirds and insects. They are often covered with abundant vegetation, the seeds of which have been carried there, for example, by air and water currents or by birds; but the plant variety is relatively limited (<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/island">Britannica</a>).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Scientists say that millions of years ago, there was only one large continent. This supercontinent was called Pangaea. Eventually, slow movements of the Earth's crust broke apart Pangaea into several pieces that began to drift apart. When the breakup occurred, some large chunks of land split. These fragments of land became islands. Greenland and Madagascar are these type of continental islands.
                  <br> <br>
                  Other continental islands formed because of changes in sea level. At the peak of the most recent glacial period, about 18,000 years ago, ice covered large parts of the Earth. Water was locked in glaciers, and the sea level was much lower than it is today. As glaciers began to melt, the sea level rose. The ocean flooded many low-lying areas, creating islands such as the British Isles, which were once part of mainland Europe.
                  <br> <br>
                  Continental islands may form through the weathering and erosion of a link of land that once connected an island to the mainland. Tidal islands are a type of continental island where land connecting the island to the mainland has not completely eroded, but is underwater at high tide. The famous island of Mont Saint-Michel, France is an example of a tidal island. Barrier islands are narrow and lie parallel to coastlines. Some are a part of the continental shelf (continental islands) and made of sediment—sand, silt, and gravel. Barrier islands can also be coral islands, made from billions of tiny coral exoskeletons. Barrier islands are separated from shore by a lagoon or a sound. They are called barrier islands because they act as barriers between the ocean and the mainland. They protect the coast from being directly battered by storm waves and winds. Some barrier islands form when ocean currents pile up sand on sandbars parallel to coastlines. Eventually the sandbars rise above the water as islands. Aits, or islands in rivers, form in this way. The same currents that formed these barrier islands can also destroy or erode them.
                  <br> <br>
                  Oceanic islands, also known as volcanic islands, are formed by eruptions of volcanoes on the ocean floor. No matter what their height, oceanic islands are also known as “high islands.” Continental and coral islands, which may be hundreds of meters taller than high islands, are called “low islands.” As volcanoes erupt, they build up layers of lava that may eventually break the water's surface. When the tops of the volcanoes appear above the water, an island is formed. While the volcano is still beneath the ocean surface, it is called a seamount.
                  <br> <br>
                  Oceanic islands can form from different types of volcanoes. One type forms in subduction zones, where one tectonic plate is shifting under another. The island nation of Japan sits at the site of four tectonic plates. Two of these plates, the Eurasian plate to the west and the North American plate to the north, are associated with continental shelves. The other two, the Philippine plate and the Pacific plate, are oceanic. The heavy oceanic plates (the Pacific and the Philippine) are subducting beneath the lighter Eurasian and North American plates. Japan's islands are some of the most actively volcanic in the world.
                  <br> <br>
                  Coral islands are low islands formed in warm waters by tiny sea animals called corals. Corals build up hard external skeletons of calcium carbonate. This material, also known as limestone, is similar to the shells of sea creatures like clams and mussels. Colonies of corals may form huge reefs. Some coral reefs may grow up in thick layers from the seafloor, until they break the water's surface, creating coral islands. Other organic and inorganic material, like rock and sand, helps create coral islands. The islands of the Bahamas, in the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea, are coral islands. Another kind of coral island is the atoll. An atoll is a coral reef that begins by growing in a ring around the sides of an oceanic island. As the volcano slowly sinks into the sea, the reef continues to grow. Atolls are found chiefly in the Pacific and Indian Oceans.
                  <br> <br>
                  Artificial islands can expand part of an already-existing island by draining the water around it. This creates more arable land for development or agriculture. The Nahua people of 14th-century Mexico created their capital, Tenochtitlan, from an artificial island in Lake Texcoco. They expanded an island in the swampy lake and connected it to the mainland through roads. Aqueducts supplied the city's 200,000 residents with freshwater. Mexico City sits on the remains of Tenochtitlan. Artificial islands can also be created from material brought in from elsewhere. In Dubai, companies dig (dredge) sand from the Persian Gulf and spray it near shore. Dubai's huge artificial islands are shaped like palm trees and a map of the world. A new island complex, the Dubai Waterfront, will be the largest man-made development in the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The kinds of organisms that live on and around an island depend on how that island was formed and where it is located. Continental islands have wildlife much like that of the continent they were once connected to. The critically endangered island fox, native to the six Channel Islands off southern California, is much like the grey fox of the North American mainland, for instance.
                  <br> <br>
                  Some plant seeds may travel by drifting in the ocean. The seeds of coconut palms, for instance, are encased in durable, buoyant shells that can float significant distances. The seeds of red mangrove trees often float to new locations along a coastline. Other plant seeds travel to islands on the wind. Many lightweight seeds, such as fluffy thistle seeds and the spores of ferns, can drift long distances in air currents. Still other plant seeds may be transported to islands by birds—dirt stuck on their feet or feathers, or released in their droppings.
                  <br> <br>
                  Other creatures may ride to islands on floating masses of plants, branches, and soil, sometimes with trees still standing on them. These land rafts are called floating islands. Floating islands are usually torn from coasts and swept away during storms, volcano eruptions, earthquakes, and floods. Floating islands can carry small animals hundreds of kilometers to new homes on islands. Snakes, turtles, insects, and rodents find shelter in tree branches or among plant leaves. Some of the best travelers are lizards, which can survive a long time with little freshwater.
                  <br> <br>
                  Because plants and animals living on islands are isolated, they sometimes change to adapt to their surroundings. Adaptive radiation is a process in which many species develop to fill a variety of different roles, called niches, in the environment. The most famous example of adaptive radiation is probably the evolution of the finch species of the Galapagos Islands. This group of birds is called “Darwin's finches” because the scientist Charles Darwin was the first to study and document their adaptations. With no competition or threats from other species, the birds adapted to eat different foods. Their beaks reflect the different roles they play in the Galapagos Islands ecosystem: a finch with a large beak eats hard-shelled fruits and nuts, while a thin-beaked finch gets its nutrition from cactus flowers.
                  <br> <br>
                  Lacking predators, some island creatures become enormous. This is called island gigantism. Also on the Galapagos Islands, giant tortoises developed from smaller ancestors over millions of years. Scientists believe the first tortoises probably came to the islands from South America on floating islands. Gradually, the animals grew larger in body size because there were few competitors for the plants they ate. Today, the tortoises may weigh as much as 250 kilograms (551 pounds). Scalesias, plants related to sunflowers, gradually grew larger on the Galapagos Islands, too, because there were few insects or rodents that ate the flowers. Eventually, scalesia trees grew to be 6-9 meters (20-30 feet) tall. Scalesias are called the “Darwin's finches of the plant world.”
                  <br> <br>
                  The isolated populations on islands can lead to smaller, as well as larger, species. This process is called insular dwarfism. The critically endangered Sumatran tiger is only found on the island of Sumatra, Indonesia. It is significantly smaller than its Asian cousins, because it has less land to roam, smaller prey to feed on, and must move quickly in the jungle. The isolation of many islands may protect some animals on them from predators and other dangers that exist on mainlands. Relatives of some animals long extinct in most parts of the world still survive on islands.
                  <br> <br>
                  One of the most remarkable of all creatures was discovered in 1913 on the island of Komodo, Indonesia. Rumors of fantastic animals on Komodo had persisted over the years. When scientists arrived to investigate, they were astounded to see what looked like a dragon. The creature was a gigantic lizard nearly 3 meters (10 feet) long. Soon, more of these enormous reptiles were discovered, some even larger. Called Komodo dragons, they were found to be relatives to the Earth's most ancient group of lizards. The isolation of the island of Komodo had preserved them.

                      <br>
                      The British explorer and environmentalist Richard Sowa built his own floating island off the east coast of Mexico in 1998. Spiral Island was created from more than 250,000 plastic bottles collected in large fishing nets. Sowa put a bamboo flooring over the bottles, and carried sand and plants onto Spiral Island. The empty, lightweight bottles float on the top of the Gulf of Mexico and support Sowa's home and garden.
                      <br> <br>
                      Spiral Island was destroyed in 2005 by Hurricane Emily. Sowa then built Spiral Island II, also from plastic bottles.
